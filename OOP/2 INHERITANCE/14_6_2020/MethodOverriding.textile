---------------------------- Method overriding -----------------------------

Definition

Method overriding is a process in which a subclass extends the superclass and inherits the superclass function by changing the method definition without changing the method declration.

Note:-
-> For method overriding inheritance is mandatory.

Annotation
-> An annotation is a extra saftey provided by the language to perform a perticular task.

For method overriding we can use the ->@Override<- for method overriding.
this annotation should always be used in the subclass where the function is overrriden.

-> The access specifier of the overloaded function can be changed based on some rules which will be stated in access specifier class.

----> Method overloading and method overriding can be implemented in all the 5 types of inheritances.
