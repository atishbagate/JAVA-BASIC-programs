---------------------- Inheritance Notes ----------------------

3] Hierarchical Inheritance
It is a kind of inheritance where two or more subclasses inherit
the properties from one common superclass. 

Hierarchical inheritance can be achieved in 2 steps

a] Generalization
It is a process of collection the common properties of all subclasses and putting them under one common superclass.

b] Specialization
It is a process of developing specific properties to specific subclasses. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
4] Multiple Inheritance
It is a kind of inheritance in which one subclass inherits the properites from two or more superclasses.

-->Multiple inheritance cannot be achieved in java using the concept of classes,abstract classes but can be achieved with the help of interface.<----
----------------------------------------------------------------

5] Hybrid inheritance
It is a combination of single,multilevel,hierarchical and multiple inheritances.

Note:-

Every class in java directly or indirectly inherits properties from Object class.

if the programmer deosn't write extends Object implicitly then the compiler writes explicitly at comile time.
