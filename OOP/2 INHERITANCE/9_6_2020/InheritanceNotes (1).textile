---------------------- Inheritance Notes ----------------------

3] Hierarchical Inheritance
It is a kind of inheritance where two or more subclasses inherit
the properties from one common superclass. 

Hierarchical inheritance can be achieved in 2 steps

a] Generalization
It is a process of collection the common properties of all subclasses and putting them under one common superclass.

b] Specialization
It is a process of developing specific properties to specific subclasses.
