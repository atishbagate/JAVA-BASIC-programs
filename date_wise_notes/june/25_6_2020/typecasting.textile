--------------- TypeCasting Notes -------------------------

Defination
It is process of converting one kind of kind/type/form data into another kind/type/form of data.

There are 2 types of data
1] Primitive 
2] Non-primitive
----------------------------------------------------
primitive     -> non-primitive => not possible
non-primitive -> primitive     => not possible
----------------------------------------------------
primitive     -> primitive     => possible
non-primitive -> non-primitive => possible
----------------------------------------------------
TypeCasting is divided into 2 types

a] Primitive casting
b] Derived casting
-----------------------
a] Primitive Casting
It is a process of converting one primitive kind of data into another primitive kind of data.
            There 8 primitive datatypes

Datatype        Capacity

byte            1 byte
boolean         1 byte
short           2 bytes
char            2 bytes
int             4 bytes
float           4 bytes
long            8 bytes
double          8 bytes 

Primitive casting is divided into 2 types
1] Widening
2] Narrowing

1] Widening
It is a process of converting lower type data into higher type of data.

2] Narrowing
It is a process of converting Higher type data into lower type of data. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
typecasting is required for memory management.
typecasting is required to prevent data loss.
