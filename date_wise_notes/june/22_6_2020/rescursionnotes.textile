----------------------- Recursion Notes -------------------------------------


Recursion Defination:-
It is a process in which the fuction executes multiple times in a loop.

Recursion may lead to stackOverFlowError if it is not controled.

                              Recursion
                                  |

      Direct Recursion                       Indirect Recursion   

Direct Recursion 
It is a process in which the function calls itself direct again and again.              
-> refer program Recursion1.java

Indirect Recurstion
It is a process in which one function calls another function which calls another function util it calls the first function.
-> refer program Recursion2.java
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncontrolled recursion is not usefull.

Controlled recursion can be used for repeatative tasks.

Controlled refcursions
-> Recursion can be controlled with the help of decision making statements like if, if-else or else-if.
