---------------------------- TypeCasting Notes ----------------------------

Derived Casting

It is process of converting one class type of data into another class type of data .
Derived casting can be achived only when two or more classes are in relation(Is-A/Inheritance).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1] Upcasting
It is a process in which the subclass object's address is stored in superclass reference variable.

---->The superclass reference variable which is pointing towards the  sunclass's object is called as -> Upcasted Reference <-.
-> Using the upcasted reference we can only acess the superclass properties.
-> Inheritance is mandatory for upcasting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2] DownCasting
It is a process of converting the upCasted reference back to subclass reference.

----> The subclass reference variable which is pointing towards the subclass object is called as ->downcasted reference<-.
-> Downcasting has to be done forcebly by using the casting statement.
-> Using the downcasted reference we can access both superclass properties as well as subclass properties.
-> Inheritance and upcasting are mandatory for downcasting.
