---------------------------- Diamond Problem --------------------------------
Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java using classes?

1] It creates a confusion or ambiguity for compiler to copy the object class properties to the subclass because of multiple paths available.

2] It creates a confusion or ambiguity to which superclass constuctor to be called from subclass constructor using super statement since there multiple superclasses present.

3] It creates a confusion for jvm to access superclass properties from subclass when multiple superclasses have same property names.
