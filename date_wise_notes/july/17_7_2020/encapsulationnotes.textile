---------------------------------- Encapsulation Notes ----------------------

​

Definition

It is a process in which we hide the data members of a class by minimizing their visibility and providing the access by custom setters and getters.

​

Steps to achieve encapsulation

​

1] make the class data members as private.

2] create custom setters and getters.

​

​

​

Setter functions

These functions are used to initialize and reinilizie the private data members of the class.

syntax :

​

public void customSetterName(datatype formalParameter){

	

	custom code....

	initialization code.....

​

}

​

​

Getter functions

These functions are used to retrive the values from the private data members.

syntax :

​

public datatype* customGetterName(){

	

	Custom code.....

	return (value/ref of private data member);

}

* Of the private data member's value trying to return.

​

​

The classes in which the data members are private and their access is granted throuh getters and setters are callled as -> Encapsulated classes/ POJO classes (Plain Old Java Objects) <-.
