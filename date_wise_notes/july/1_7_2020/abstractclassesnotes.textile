------------------------ Abstract Classes -------------------------------

Abstract functions/methods

Defination
Any function which has a declration but no defination is called as abstract function.

-> Abstract functions should be declared with abstract keyword.
-> Any function which has both declration and definition are called as concrete functions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract Classes

Defination
Any class which is declared with the keyword abstract is known as abstract class.

-> If a class contains atleast one abstract function then the class should be declared with abstract keyword.
-> If a class contains zero abstract function then such classes are called as concrete classes.
-> An abstract class can contain both concrete and abstract functions.
-> An abstract class can contain zero abstract functions.
-> Object cannot be created for abstract classes nut reference variable can be created for abstract classes.

-> When a class extends an abstract class it has 2 option
1] declare itself as abstract 
2] provide the implementations/bodies for the superclass abstract methods by overriding them.
