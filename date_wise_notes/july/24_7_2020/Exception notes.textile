                   What JVM does When an exception occurs.

1] When an line results in an unexpected operation JVM creates the corresponding exception class object and throws it within the called function.

2] If no code is written to take care of the exception in the called function then JVM will remove the frame from exe and throws the exception object to the calling function.

3] If no code is written to take care of the exception in the calling function then JVM will remove the frame from exe and calls a software called Default Exception Handler(D.E.H).

4] D.E.H will no take care of the exception but it prints 2 importent messages regaring the exception which helps the programmer.

a] Fully qualified exception class name.
b] Reason for the cause of exception
3] stackTrace
