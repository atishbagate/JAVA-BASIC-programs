---------------------------- Relations ---------------------------------------

A relation is a connection or a bond or a link between two or more entities like classes or interfaces or abstract classes.

-> Java Has two major kinds of relations

1] Association [Has-A] relation.
2] Inheritance [Is-A] relation.

------------------------------------------------------------

1] Association [Has-A] relation.

Association is just a relation between two classes which are connected with the help of their respective objects.

ex:
2 preople            
                       weaker relation                    Stonger relation
friendship             ramesh---> friend              ramesh---> best friend      
                       suresh---> best friend         suresh---> best friend

Association is divided into to types based on the dependency

a] Weaker Has-A relation     [Aggregation]
b] Stronger Has-A relation   [Composition]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1] Weaker Has-A relation     [Aggregation]
It is a kind of relation in which the existance of one object is not mutually dependent on the existance of the other object.

It's an unidirectional relationship

exmaple:- refer program Aggregation.java

               GoogleAcc -----xxxx----> PlayStore
